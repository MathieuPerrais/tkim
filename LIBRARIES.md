# LIBRARIES
_Like most people, when I come across a library or framework that I like I usually ⭐️ **star** it.  
This is not great, as of March 2021 I have [159 starred repositories](https://github.com/MathieuPerrais?tab=stars) most of them embarrassingly old and out of date.  
Hopefully this will stay a relevant list of libraries and frameworks to be considered for iOS and MacOS projects._
